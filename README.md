# Prediction-simulation-and-visualization-of-rain-fields-in-Northern-California
Rain fields show complex behavior that is difficult to reproduce with physical models while data-driven approach can be beneficial in a number of applications. Python was the programming language for this project. I implemented a methods from scratch using basic linear algebra tools available in NumPy/SciPy packages.
